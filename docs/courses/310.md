# CPSC 310

A brief set of instructions for configuring Classy for 310.

### Initial Setup

* Request that the tech staff provision a VM and configure classy (including all required `autobot` tokens and the `github.student` org and `admin/staff` teams) for the term.
* Visit the [classy instance](https://cs310.students.cs.ubc.ca), import the classlist (using the `Update Classlist` API button in the config tab), and provision the deliverables (at least `d0` as shown below).
* Provision some repositories.

<!--
* Request a VM from the tech staff by emailing `help@cs`.
* Request a GitHub org from the tech staff by emailing `help@cs`.
	* In the org settings (under Member Privileges):
		* `Allow members to delete or transfer repositories for this organization` should be `false`.
		* `Allow members to change repository visibilities for this organization` should be `false`.
		* `Allow forking of private repositories` should be `false`.
		* Create a `staff` team; add all TAs to this team.
		* Create an `admin` team; add all faculty and `autobot` to this team.
* Install Classy on the VM using the other instructions in this directory.
-->

### Monitoring Classy

The VM should have monitoring configured by default:

* Create tunnel on your machine: `ssh -L19999:localhost:19999 cs310.students.cs.ubc.ca`
* Connect: `http://localhost:19999`

### Configuring Classy

* Create your Deliverables (`d0`, `d1`, `d2`, `d3`, `d4`, and `project`). The two deliverables that will provision repositories are `d0` and `project`.

# Provisioning repos

* Visit `Manage Repositories` in the classy Config tab.
* If you want initial grading on all the repos you provision, be sure to set the `Default deliverable` in the config tab first.
* Select the deliverable you want to provision, and then the repos you want to provision (I would start with one, but if you're feeling lucky do them all). 
	* This will create the repo and give staff access to it, but _not_ the students. 
	* This task will take a long time (~10-15 seconds per repo), you can't close the browser while this is happening.
	* You can watch progress using the Classy toast, or just visit the Github dashboard for the term to see repos show up.
* When you're happy with the repositories that have been provisioned you can release them to the students. 
	* This might require refreshing the `Provision & Release` results (do this by just toggling the deliverable dropdown).
	* Select the repos you want to release and release them. This is a fast task (a few seconds at most per repository).
	* Students should then have access to the repo.
	* Make sure the `Default deliverable` is set in the config tab so that AutoTest runs on all pushes.
