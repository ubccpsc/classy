# Bootstrapping Classy for Development

Configuring your development instance of Classy can occur without building the Docker containers. The [Classy](https://github.com/ubccpsc/classy) repository consists of two RESTful APIs and a JavaScript  front-end application that is served by on one of the RESTful APIs as static HTML content. These applications can be run separately, or together, in your IDE or from the command line in debugging mode. TypeScript source maps are produced during compilation for debugging the application during runtime.

## Software Dependencies

The software dependencies that are currently used in production and recommended to work in development:

- Node JS > v12.13.0 [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn v1.15.2 [Installation](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)
- Docker v19.03.4, build 9013bf583a [Install](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- IDE: JetBrain's Webstorm is recommended; VSCode is supported
- MongoDB > 3.6.7 (Docker: `docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo`, or [Install](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/))

**NOTE**: MongoDB must be running before starting **AutoTest** or **Portal**.

## Environmental Config

You will need to ensure the required environment variables, which you can see in `packages/common/Config.ts`, are set. This can be done by copying `.env.sample` to `.env` in the root of the project and modifying as needed. It is ***CRUCIAL*** that your `.env` file is never committed to version control.

The sample configuration file includes a lot of documentation inline so [take a look](https://github.com/ubccpsc/classy/blob/master/.env.sample).

## GitHub Setup

Classy manages administrators using GitHub teams. The GitHub organization that the course uses should have a `staff` and `admin` team. GitHub users on the `staff` and `admin` teams will have access to the Classy Admin Portal, although users on the `staff` team will have greater privileges (e.g., the ability to configure the course). The bot user should be added as an owner of the organization.

## Install/Build/Run

To install Classy for development:

1. Type `git clone https://github.com/ORGNAME/classy`
2. `cd Classy` to navigate inside the directory.
3. Inside the directory, type `yarn install` to fetch library dependencies.
4. Then type `yarn run build` to build the project.

   During the build step, a source-map was produced with the built code, which allows you to set breakpoints and debug in your IDE.

5. You are ready to run any of the applications (commands found in `package.json` files under respective application package directories).

## QA Checklist

More checks may need to be made depending on the nature of your work, but these are the recommended checks:

1. [ ] Portal Back-end compiles
2. [ ] Portal Front-end compiles
3. [ ] AutoTest compiles
4. [ ] CI tests pass for Portal Back-end
5. [ ] CI tests pass for AutoTest
6. [ ] Project containers build successfully (`docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up`)

*NOTE*:

- Items 1-5 can all be fulfilled by CircleCI integration.
- Item 6 can only be done manually at this time.
- Item 6 requires a properly setup environmental file with SSL certificates.
