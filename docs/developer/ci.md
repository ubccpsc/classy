### Repo Retirement

Occasionally, a Github organization will encounter an API bug that cannot be resolved without technical support (which may take time). If you do re-create an organization, repository names that are deleted with an organization will be **retired**. Retiring a repository precludes the creation of a new repository with the same name under the organization when it is re-created.

If this issue is encountered, you may either have to contact Github to coordinate un-retiring repositories or create a new organization name.
