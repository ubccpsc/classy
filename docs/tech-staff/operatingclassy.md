Docker Compose is a Docker orchestration tool that is used to streamline basic operations tasks. Docker Compose commands can build, start, and stop Classy. Logs may also be compiled from multiple sources and viewed.

## Building Classy

```bash
cd /opt/classy

# Create a subnet that the grading containers will attach to. This makes it easier to set up firewall rules (above).
docker network create --attachable --ip-range "172.28.5.0/24" --gateway "172.28.5.254" --subnet "172.28.0.0/16" grading_net

# if plugin in .env file is not 'default', run the command to configure the new plugin
./helper-scripts/bootstrap-plugin.sh

# then build Classy with Docker
docker-compose build
```

You can also build just a subset of classy, which can save time; the main modules that need rebuilding are:

```bash
docker-compose build portal autotest
```

## Starting Classy

Classy is a containerized application that requires containers are built before the application can be run. Building a container is necessary to make a copy of an image that Docker can run.

If this is a new instance of Classy OR code has been updated, it is necessary to build or re-build Classy. See [Building Classy](#building-classy) for instructions on how to build Classy.

```bash
# docker-compose commands must be run from the following directory
cd /opt/classy
```

Start up everything:

    ```
    bash
    docker-compose up --detach
    ```

    You should now be able to open portal on the host you've installed classy on (e.g. <https://$(hostname)>).
    The system should also be able to receive commit and comment events from GitHub and process them accordingly.

If you want to start a single service, execute: (where `<service>` is something like 'db')
```bash
docker-compose up -d <service>
```

If you want to run the db for testing, execute:
```bash
docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

If you want to run the db for development with persistent data, execute:
```bash
docker run -p 27017:27017 -v /var/opt/classy/db:/data/db mongo
```

## Stopping Classy

To shut down everything:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
## Restarting Classy

To restart Classy (this restarts the _current_ containers and is not sufficient if you are building new images):

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

If you're restarting after updating images, use:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Viewing Classy Runtime Logs

To view the logs while Classy is running:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

To watch the logs stream as Classy is executing:

```bash
docker-compose logs --tail 1000 -f
```

To see only what the most recent logs say:

```bash
docker-compose logs --tail 1000
```

## Reclaiming disk space

Docker is conservative about disk space and will not delete old containers when new ones are created. If your course is building many grading containers (in particular) these can add up and cause disk pressure on the system. If the host ever run out of disk, stale images can be pruned with:

```bash
docker image prune
```

This is an alarming operation, and unfortunately there is no `--dry-run` option, but has been reliably used in the past and only seems to delete the 'excess' containers.
