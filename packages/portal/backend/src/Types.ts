/**
 * A goal of these types is to make it easier (and more efficient)
 * to perform the most common queries. These include:
 *
 * 1) List all students (easy, directly from people)
 * 2) List all teams and student members (easy, just join teams with people)
 * 3) List most recent results for a deliverable (easy, directly from results)
 * 3) List all results for a deliverable for each user
 *     Harder. Problem is we don't have a 1:1 mapping between repo and deliverable.
 *     Or maybe we just need to roll with this:
 *          Join person with Teams (on Person.id -> Teams.members) as t and to Repositories
 *          (t.id ->  Repository.teams) as r
 *          Iterate through each person record.
 *              Find all results for the desired delivId for any r above. Return for each person.
 *              This doesn't combine teams, but makes it so people won't be missed.
 *              Result: PersonRecord[]
 * 4) List most recent results for a team (3 above with date limit)
 * 5) List all people on a repo
 *      Join with Team with repo.teamIds then join with People using team.peopleIds
 *
 * G1) Store a new grade (easy, directly from Grade)
 *      * use grade.delivId & grade.personId to make sure there is only one of these records.
 *      * write or overwrite as needed
 *
 * R1) Store a new result (XXX THINKING IN PROGRESS)
 *      * result.delivId (needed to create a grade record)
 *      * result.repoId (needed to get a list of people to create grade records on (see #5 above,
 *      list all people on repo)
